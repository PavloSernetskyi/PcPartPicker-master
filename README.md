How we met:
We met up every Friday since the assignment of the project (except for holidays) to collaborate and split up responsibilities. In total, we met up around 5 times, for a couple hours each time. Additionally, we collaborated extensively throughout the semester using text, which also helped us to plan out elements of the project.

Project Description:
The project we created was a GUI application that gave the user several options of picking PC parts. When building a PC there are many different parts that you have to choose, things like RAM, a case, and a CPU. The application would involve giving many different options for each PC part with their respective prices which would then be added up as you select them. When you are finished, a final screen would show up, showing you the configuration you selected. 

The project used object-oriented programming extensively, as well as many of the GUI features we learned in class using Java Swing. We used data types such as ArrayLists, as well as the concepts of polymorphism, among many other things.
